```

## About Rules

- Rules are generated by PRISM
- The data to obtain the rules are obtained from [kaggle](mubeenshehzadi/infant-wellness-and-risk-evaluation-dataset)
- There are some conflicts for the generated rules, therefore

### Rules Conflicts Resolution

1. Give "At Risk" rules higher priority than "Healthy" rules, so critical conditions are evaluated first: `(declare (salience 100))`.
2. Then add logic to prevent "Healthy" conclusions if "At Risk" already fired: `(not (conclusion (id ?case-id) (target "At Risk)))`
3. Give lower priority for healthy rules: `(declare (salience 50))`
